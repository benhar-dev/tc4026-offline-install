## Overview

Quick start guide for upgrading an IPC to 4026 with no internet connection.

## Steps

All steps below assume that TwinCAT Package Manager has been installed on both Engineering and IPC.

1. **Create a Folder for Offline Files**  
   On your engineering laptop, create a folder named `C:\PackagesOffline`.

2. **Download the Required Packages**  
   Use the following commands to download the necessary packages. Only the `TwinCAT.Standard.XAE` package is required if you're using engineering tools.

   - To list available workloads, run:

     ```bash
     tcpkg list -t workload
     ```

   - Typical packages to download:
     ```bash
     tcpkg download TwinCAT.Standard.XAE -o "C:\PackagesOffline"
     tcpkg download TwinCAT.Standard.XAR -o "C:\PackagesOffline"
     tcpkg download TwinCAT.XAE.MigrateCli -o "C:\PackagesOffline"
     # add as many packages or workflows as needed
     ```

3. **Transfer Files to the IPC**  
   Once all packages are downloaded, copy the `C:\PackagesOffline` folder to the IPC.

4. **Set Up the Package Manager**  
   Add the local package source using the following command:

   ```bash
   tcpkg source add -n=Local -s=C:\PackagesOffline --priority=1
   ```

   If you make a mistake while setting the local source, you can remove it with

   ```bash
   tcpkg source remove local
   ```

5. **Install the Migration Package**
   Install the migration CLI tool with this command:

   ```bash
   tcpkg install TwinCAT.XAE.MigrateCli
   ```

6. **\*Reboot and Upgrade**
   Reboot the system, then run the following command to upgrade (note: the command is case-sensitive):

   ```bash
   TcMigrateCmd upgrade --whatIf False
   ```
